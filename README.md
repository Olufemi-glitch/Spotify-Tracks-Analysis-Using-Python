Spotify Tracks Analysis Using Python

Overview

Spotify, founded on April 23, 2006, by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, is a leading Swedish audio streaming and media services provider. As of June 2023, Spotify boasts over 551 million monthly active users, including 220 million paying subscribers. It offers a vast library of more than 100 million songs and five million podcasts, sourced from record labels and media companies.

Spotify operates on a freemium model, where basic features are available for free with advertisements and limited functionality. Paid subscriptions unlock additional features, such as offline listening and ad-free streaming. Users can search for music by artist, album, or genre, as well as create, edit, and share playlists.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze Spotify tracks data using Python to uncover patterns and relationships between track features such as energy, loudness, and acousticness, providing actionable insights into the nature of music streamed on Spotify.

Key Insights and Findings

Correlation Analysis
A high positive correlation of 0.76 was observed between energy and loudness, indicating that tracks with higher energy levels tend to have louder sound levels.
A high negative correlation of -0.72 was observed between energy and acousticness, suggesting that tracks with higher energy levels are generally less acoustic.
Data Patterns
Energy: High-energy tracks dominate playlists, often associated with upbeat and loud music.
Acousticness: Lower acousticness values were linked to modern, digitally enhanced tracks, as opposed to raw, unplugged performances.
Methodology

The analysis was performed using Python and leveraged various data analysis and visualization libraries such as:

Pandas for data wrangling.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for correlation heatmaps and distribution plots.
NumPy for numerical computations.

Key steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and relationships.
Correlation matrix generation to assess feature relationships.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Music Curation:
Tracks with high energy and loudness should be prioritized for party or workout playlists, appealing to users seeking dynamic music experiences.
Playlist Personalization:
Acoustic tracks with lower energy levels can cater to audiences preferring calm or instrumental music.
Content Strategy:
Further analysis on other features like danceability, tempo, and valence can help Spotify refine its recommendation algorithms and offer tailored listening experiences.
This project highlights how Python-based data analysis can uncover meaningful insights, enhancing Spotify's ability to understand user preferences and improve the overall music streaming experience. ðŸŽ¶
